Description
-----------

This program solves a maze containing a starting point (0), ending point (*), open area (~) and blocked off area (X). It associates a number with each entry in the maze and then backtracks using the shortest path to find the shortest path between the two points.


Files
-----

maker.cpp - This file will create a random maze from two user-inputted values for the row and column

maze.cpp - This file represents the actual maze solving algorithm and takes user input representing a row and column as well as the maze to solve


Environment
-----------

The program uses a color scheme to highlight each component of the maze that's only present on Linux systems, so Linux is the only compatible operating system to run these files in.
